## Test Case 1: Normal Input
- Objective: Test the program with standard input for all days.
- Input: Provide valid names, dates, and descriptions for each day.
- Expected Output: The program should correctly display all entered details without errors.

## Test Case 2: Invalid Date Input
- Objective: Test how the program handles invalid date inputs (e.g., negative numbers, non-integer values).
- Input: Enter a negative number or a non-integer for the date field.
- Expected Output: The program should handle invalid input gracefully, either by requesting the user to re-enter the data or by displaying an error message.

## Test Case 3: Long String Input
- Objective: Test the program's handling of very long string inputs for names and descriptions.
- Input: Enter extremely long strings for the name and description fields.
- Expected Output: The program should either handle the long input correctly or display an error message if the input exceeds buffer size.

## Test Case 4: Empty String Input
- Objective: Test the program's response to empty string inputs for names and descriptions.
- Input: Enter empty strings for some or all of the name and description fields.
- Expected Output: The program should prompt the user to re-enter the data or handle the empty input appropriately.
Test Case 5: Special Characters in Input
Objective: Check how the program deals with special characters or non-alphabetic characters in names and descriptions.
Input: Include special characters (like @, #, !, etc.) in the name and description fields.
Expected Output: The program should either accept these characters without issue or display an appropriate error message.
Test Case 6: Memory Allocation Failure Simulation
Objective: Test the program's behavior in case of memory allocation failure.
Input: Simulate memory allocation failure (this might require modifying the code to forcefully make malloc return NULL).
Expected Output: The program should check for NULL pointers after memory allocation and handle the failure gracefully, likely by displaying an error message and exiting.
Test Case 7: Non-Standard Input Format
Objective: Test how the program handles unexpected or non-standard input formats.
Input: Enter data in a format different from what is expected (like using letters for the date field).
Expected Output: The program should either handle the non-standard input format appropriately or display an error message.
