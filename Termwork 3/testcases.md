Test Case 1: Pushing Characters to the Stack
Input: Choose option 1 (Push to stack) and enter characters like 'x', 'y', 'z'.
Expected Output: The program should indicate that each character is successfully pushed onto the stack.

Test Case 2: Popping Characters from the Stack
Input: After pushing some characters, choose option 2 (Pop from stack).
Expected Output: The program should pop the top character from the stack and display it.

Test Case 3: Displaying the Top Element
Input: After pushing some characters, choose option 3 (Display top element).
Expected Output: The program should display the character at the top of the stack.

Test Case 4: Displaying All Stack Elements
Input: After pushing some characters, choose option 4 (Display all stack elements).
Expected Output: The program should list all characters currently in the stack.

Test Case 5: Checking for Palindrome (Positive Test)
Input: Choose option 5 (Check if a number is a palindrome) and enter '121'.
Expected Output: The program should indicate that '121' is a palindrome.

Test Case 6: Checking for Palindrome (Negative Test)
Input: Choose option 5 and enter '123'.
Expected Output: The program should indicate that '123' is not a palindrome.

Test Case 7: Empty Stack Pop Operation
Input: Choose option 2 (Pop from stack) without any prior push operation.
Expected Output: The program should indicate a stack underflow or that the stack is empty.

Test Case 8: Full Stack Push Operation
Input: Repeatedly choose option 1 (Push to stack) until the stack is full (up to its maximum capacity).
Expected Output: The program should eventually indicate a stack overflow or that the stack is full.

Test Case 9: Exiting the Program
Input: Choose option 6 (Exit).
Expected Output: The program should terminate without errors.
