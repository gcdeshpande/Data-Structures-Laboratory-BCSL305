Let's create a smaller example with a TABLE_SIZE of 10 to demonstrate the sample input and output more clearly.

### Sample Input:
```
Insert keys: 15, 25, 35, 45
```
### Expected Output:
```
Inserted key: 15 at index: 5
Inserted key: 25 at index: 6
Inserted key: 35 at index: 7
Inserted key: 45 at index: 8
```

### Searching for Key 25:
```
Search for key 25.
```
### Expected Output for Searching:
```
Key 25 found at index: 6
```
