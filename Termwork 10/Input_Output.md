Let's consider the Binary Search Tree (BST) operations as described in the program. Given the input sequence of integers to create the BST:

Copy code
6, 9, 5, 2, 8, 15, 24, 14, 7, 8, 5, 2
Note: Duplicates will be ignored in this implementation since we haven't handled duplicates specifically. The BST will only include unique values from this sequence.

Sample Input and Output
Menu Display
mathematica
Copy code
Menu
1. Display Inorder
2. Display Preorder
3. Display Postorder
4. Search
5. Exit
Enter your choice:
Option 1: Display Inorder
When the user selects option 1, the output will be the BST traversed in Inorder, which displays elements in ascending order.

Input
Copy code
1
Output
Copy code
2 5 6 7 8 9 14 15 24 
Option 2: Display Preorder
Selecting option 2 displays the BST traversed in Preorder (root, left, right).

Input
Copy code
2
Output
Copy code
6 5 2 8 7 9 15 14 24 
Option 3: Display Postorder
Selecting option 3 displays the BST traversed in Postorder (left, right, root).

Input
Copy code
3
Output
Copy code
2 7 8 5 14 24 15 9 6 
Option 4: Search
When the user selects option 4, they are prompted to enter an element to search for in the BST. The program will then report whether the element is found or not.

Input (Element found)
css
Copy code
4
Enter the element to search: 7
Output
mathematica
Copy code
Element found
Input (Element not found)
css
Copy code
4
Enter the element to search: 10
Output
mathematica
Copy code
Element not found
Option 5: Exit
Selecting option 5 exits the program.

Input
Copy code
5
Output
Copy code

This sample demonstrates how users can interact with the program to perform various operations on the BST, including creating the BST with a predefined set of integers, traversing it in different orders, searching for a specific element, and exiting the program.
